		   <h2>Aristobot, LLC. Privacy Policy</h2>
		   
		   <div>
		   	<b>Our Privacy Policy explains:</b><br/>
			   <ul>
				   <li>What information we store and why we store it.</li>
				   <li>How we use said information.</li>
			   </ul>
		   </div>
		   
		   <p><b><u>Information we store</u></b></p>
		   
		   <div>
		   		We collect information in two ways:<br/>
		   		<ul>
				   <li>Information you give us. For example, many of our services require you to sign up for an Aristobot Games account such as an email address.</li>
				   <li>Information we gain from your use of our services. We may collect information about the services that you use and how you use them.</li>
			   </ul>
			</div>
			
			   <p><b><u>How we use information we store</u></b></p>
			   
			   <p>We use the information we store from all of our services to provide, maintain, protect and improve them, to develop new ones, and to protect Aristobot and our users. </p>
			   
			   <p>We may use the username you provide for your Aristobot profile across all of the services we offer that require an Aristobot account. In addition, we may replace past names associated with your Aristobot Account so that you are represented consistently across all our services. </p>
			   
			   <p>When you contact Aristobot, we may keep a record of your communication to help solve any issues you might be facing. We may use your email address to inform you about our services, such as letting you know about up coming changes or improvements. </p>
			   
			   <p>We will ask for your consent before using information for a purpose other than those that are set out in this Privacy Policy. </p>
			   
			   <p>We will never share or sell your personal information to third parties without your consent.</p>
			   
			   <p><b><u>Application</u></b></p>
		   
		   	   <p>Our Privacy Policy applies to all of the services offered by Aristobot, LLC.</p>
		   	   <p>Our Privacy Policy does not apply to services offered by other companies or individuals, including products or sites that may be linked from our services. Our Privacy Policy does not cover the information practices of other companies and organizations who advertise our services, and who may use cookies, pixel tags and other technologies to serve and offer relevant ads.</p>

		   		<p><b><u>Enforcement</u></b></p>
		   		
		   		<p>We regularly review our compliance with our Privacy Policy. We also adhere to several self regulatory frameworks. When we receive formal written complaints, we will contact the person who made the complaint to follow up. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that we cannot resolve with our users directly. </p>
		
				<p><b><u>Changes</u></b></p>
				
				<p>Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent. We will post any privacy policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of privacy policy changes). We will also keep prior versions of this Privacy Policy in an archive for your review. </p>
